  <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This document is owned and approved by **Document Owner** as a component of the company compliance regime.
      </p>
  <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>**Organisation** needs to operate in a manner which demonstrates that physical, technical and personnel risks are adequately controlled. This allows clients to trust **Organisation** to deliver engagements which involve handing client data and ensures that **Organisation** meets data protection and other legislative requirements.

</p>
  <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document details procedures and responsibilities applicable to all **Organisation** staff, associates and contractors provided with **Organisation** user accounts, who are described as “Users” within this document.
      </p>
  <h2>Document Amendment</h2>
      <p>If, during the course of your duties, you become aware of any amendments that should be made to this document, you should inform the **Document Owner**.
      </p>
  <h2>Compliance</h2>
  <p>Users will be required to acknowledge this document before they are issued with a device or user account. All users will be required to repeat the acknowledgement on an annual basis or when there is a change to the document which is material to the user responsibilities.
  </p>
      <h1>Client Data</h1>
      <p>The following rules must be followed at all times, if you believe that you need to break any of these rules to deliver a client or business requirement you must escalate this to **Document Owner**.
        <ul>
          <li>Client data must only be stored on organisation approved laptops or organisation provided online storage</li>
          <ul>
            <li>All organistion approved End User Devices(EUDs) must comply with the Cyber Essentials technical requirements, which includes at rest encryption and user authentication.</li>
            <li>All organisation approved online storage will be located in the UK and use unique user identities and multi-factor authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Client data must be stored in engagement specific areas of organisation provided online storage, so access is restricted to those users with a valid need to know and automatically backed up.</li>
          <li>Any requests to add users to engagement areas of online storage must be approved by the Director in Charge for the engagement.</li>
          <li>Client data will only be transmitted using encrypted mechanisms, only these mechanisms are available for organisation provided online storage. The use of email needs to be agreed in writing with the client or approved by **Document Owner**.</li>
          <li>Client data must not be stored or exchanged on removable media.</li>
          <li>If necessary, offline backups which include client data must be robustly encrypted and kept in company approved physically secure storage.</li>
          <li>Paper copies of client data should not be created unless you can store them securely or destroy them at the end of the working day.</li>
          <li>Paper documents must be destroyed using cross-cut shredders.</li>
          <li>Client data is provided for specific engagements so you must not use it for another engagement with the same client, without first seeking advice from **Document Owner**.</li>
          <li>Client data held electronically should never normally be requested by clients, because they already hold the data. If you receive such a request this must be referred to **Document Owner** prior to responding to the requestor.</li>
          <li>Any requests to release client data (including Subject Access Requests, Freedom of Information Act and Legislative Requests) held by **Organisation** to any party must be referred to the **Document Owner** prior to responding to the requestor or notifying the client.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
<h1>Acceptable Use</h1>
<p>The following rules apply to the acceptable use of **Organisation** facilities and client facilities when no specific policy is issued.
  <ul>
    <li>Users are provided with access to **Organisation** facilities to help them deliver activities for **Organisation** and their clients.</li>
    <li>Users must not share their devices or account credentials with anybody and must report any request to provide account credentials to **Incident Contact**.</li>
    <li>Users must use **Organisation** facilities in compliance with the law in the UK and any relevant client country.</li>
    <li>Users must not take any device, including personal devices used to access company data out of the UK or attempt to access facilities from outside the UK without prior written authorisation of **Document Owner**.</li>
    <li>If an engagement requires activities which could be in breach of the Computer Misuse Act or similar legislation, this work must not commence until written approval from the client is provided to **Document Owner**.</li>
    <li>Users may use **Organisation** facilities for limited personal activities where these do not conflict with the best interests of the business and clients. This includes, but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>activities which are illegal in the UK or any relevant client country.</li>
      <li>activities which are in breach of supplier or client contracts.</li>
      <li>activities for a commercial interest which is not **Organisation**, a client or a prospective client.</li>
      <li>Any activities which could bring **Organisation** into disrepute, which could include accessing or distributing content which could be considered discriminatory, offensive, or immoral.</li>
      <li>Any activities which prevent company facilities being available for company activities.</li>
      <li>Any activities which result in significant additional costs for the company.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>**Organisation** monitors and audits the use of IT facilities, this will include any personal activity on company owned devices.</li>
    <li>It is important to remember that content which circulates freely within some organisations could express views which are considered offensive in another organisation.</li>
  </ul>
  
</p>  
<h1>Social Media</h1>
<p>Use of social media can have an impact on the organisation whilst not using any organisation facilities. For this reason, users will refrain from posting, sharing, or otherwise engaging with content which could be considered derogatory to the organisation, derogatory to clients or could bring the organisation into disrepute.</p>
<h1>Account and Device Approval</h1>
All requests for devices and accounts, including administrator accounts must be made using the IT Request Form following the Access Management Process.
<h1>Password Policy</h1>
<p>
The password policy is aligned with NCSC good practice.
  <ul>
    <li>You must choose a password which is at least 16 chars in length.</li>
    <li>NCSC encouraged creating your password from three random words to help create long memorable passwords.</li>
    <li>You must avoid using predictable words, sequences of words or numbers:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Famous quotations, first lines of books, related words, etc.</li>
      <li>Words related or derived from usernames or information written on devices.</li>
      <li>Words, dates, sequences which could be predicted from social media.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Password must include uppercase and lowercase characters.</li>
    <li>There is a ban list which will help prevent you choosing passwords which are easy for an attacker to guess.</li>
    <li>You will NOT be forced to change your password after a certain time as elapsed.</li>
    <li>You must NOT write down your password.</li>
    <li>You must NOT use the same password for multiple devices or accounts.</li>
    <li>When ever you are issued a password for a new account or a reset you must change the password on first use.</li>
</ul>
Two factor authentication will be enabled on your accounts and devices, and you must not tamper with the configuration.
</p>
<h1>Software Installs</h1>
<p>As a normal user you must not attempt to install any additional software on **Organisation** issued devices. If additional software is required an IT Request Form needs to be raised so the impact of adding the software, including licencing and updates can be assessed. If the request is approved the software will be deployed to your machine using the endpoint management mechanism to ensure that it is installed with a standard configuration and can be updated as necessary.</p>
<h1>Automatic Updates</h1>
<p>As a user you should ensure that your device is powered up with internet access at least once every week to ensure that the device performs automatic updates. If your device has not been connected for 14 days, such as when you have been on leave, you must connect your device and allow it time to receive updates before using the device for work activities. You must not take any actions to prevent your device from receiving automatic updates in a timely manner.</p>
<h1>Network Connections</h1>
<p>Devices should only be connected to the designated network in **Organisation** offices or home broadband connections. When connecting to home broadband you must ensure that the router/access point administrator password and WiFi access password have been changed from their default to suitably strong alternatives (see password guidance in previous section).</p>
